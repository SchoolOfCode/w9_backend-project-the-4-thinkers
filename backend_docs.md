# Startup Scripts

To run these scripts, use: 
```bash
npm run db:'scriptFilename'
```
e.g. 
```bash
npm run db:populateTable
```
---
## createTable script
```js
import query from "../index.js"

const sqlString = `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comments (comments_id INT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,user_id INT, comment_text TEXT, page_id INT);`
async function createCommentsTable(){
    const res = await query(sqlString);
    console.log(res.command, "created comments table");
}
createCommentsTable();
```
### Description:
When this script is run, it will create an SQL table for storing comments in the connected database.
<br>The table will be created with 4 columns:
+ comments_id - A unique number with which to select a single comment.
+ user_id - A number corresponding to the author of the comment.
+ comment_text - The user-inputted text portion of the comment.
+ page_id - A number corresponding to the page the comment was posted on.
---
## populateTable script

```js
import query from "../index.js"
import testcomments from "../../libs/libs.js"

    async function populateCommentsTable(){
        for (let i=0; i<testcomments.length; i++){
            const res =  await query(`INSERT INTO comments (user_id, comment_text, page_id) VALUES ($1,$2,$3) RETURNING *;`, 
            [testcomments[i].user_id,testcomments[i].comment_text,testcomments[i].page_id]);
            console.log(res.command, "populated comments table");
        } 
    }
populateCommentsTable();
```
### Description:

When this script is run, it will populate the table created with the createTable script above with some pre-made comments for testing the display.<br>
These comments will be imported from the file libs.js and will take the form of an array named "_testcomments_" containing each comment as an object, with 3 key value pairs for each object:
+ user_id
+ comment_text
+ page_id
<br>

Note: The key  "_comments_id_" is not needed, since this unique number is generated for each new entry automatically by the table.

---
## dropTable script
```js
import query from "../index.js"

const sqlString = `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS comments;`;
async function createCommentsTable(){
    const res = await query(sqlString);
    console.log(res.command, "dropped comments table");
}
createCommentsTable();
```
### Description:
When this script is run, it will delete the SQL table of comments in the connected database. 


# Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file from your database credential page:

```js
PGHOST=' '
PGDATABASE=' '
PGUSER=' '
PGPORT=' '
PGPASSWORD=' '
```


# Index.js
```js
import pg from "pg";

const pool = new pg.Pool({
    user: process.env.PGUSER,
    host: process.env.PGHOST,
    database: process.env.PGDATABASE,
    password: process.env.PGPASSWORD,
    port: process.env.PGPORT,
    ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false}
});

function query(text, params, callback) {
    return pool.query(text, params, callback);
};
export default query;
```
### Description:
This file configures a new pool to connect to the database with, using the credentials from the .env file. The pool created has a _query_ method attached to it to allow for the functions in _models_ to make database queries directly, using SQL language, which is inserted as the 1st parameter of the function.


# Routes
Below are our functions that build a REST API with CRUD operators:

## Function: commentsRouter.get 
```js
    commentsRouter.get("/1", async function(req, res){
    let data = await getAllComments()
    res.json(data);})
```
### Description:
This route handles the client requests that come into the path 'users/1'.
It awaits the getAllComments function from models file which selects all the comments
from our comments table
### Parameters:
None
### Returns:
A json file with all of our user's comments data as an array of individual comment objects. 

## Function: commentsRouter.post
```js
    commentsRouter.post("/1", async function(req, res){
    let newComment = req.body;
    let data = await createComment(newComment)
    const responseObject = {
        success:true,
        message:"Comment created",
        payload:data,
    };
    res.json(responseObject);})
```
### Description:
This route handles the clients post requests that come into the path
'users/1'.  
### Parameter:
The createComment function imported from models file takes in the parameter newComment.
This variable links to the req.body object.  
### Return:
This function returns a json file with the new comment created by user, 
with the corresponding responseObject that confirms a comment has been created.

## Function: commentsRouter.delete
```js
    commentsRouter.delete("/1", async function (req,res){
    let commentToBeDeleted = req.body.comment_id
    let data = await deleteComment(commentToBeDeleted)
    const responseObject = {
        success:true,
        message:"Comment deleted",
        payload:data,
    };
    res.json(responseObject);})
```
### Description:

This route handles the delete requests taken that come into 
the path "/users/1"

### Parameters:

This deleteComment function imported from models file takes in a 
parameter called commentToBeDeleted. This variable identifies the comment_id from req.body object.


### Return:

This function returns a json file with the comment that will be deleted,
with the corresponding responseObject that confirms comment deleted.


# Models
The models files serve as a library of functions to carry out database queries when a request comes in on a given route. Each function will be imported and called on in the corresponding routes file, where a return will be generated and returned as part of the "**Response Object**".

<br>

## Getting all comments:
```js
export async function getAllComments(){
    let allComments = await query(`SELECT * FROM comments`)
    return allComments.rows;
};
```
### Description:
When called, this function queries the database for all of the comments.
### Parameters:
None, the function simply selects all of the comments in the respective table.
### Returns:
All of the comments as an array of objects. Each object has the key-value pairs of _user_id_, _comment_text_, _comment_id_ & _page_id_.

<br>

## Creating a comment:
```js
export async function createComment(newComment){
    let createCommentSQL = `INSERT INTO comments (user_id, comment_text,page_id) VALUES ($1,$2,$3) RETURNING *;`;
    let addedComment = await query (createCommentSQL, [newComment.user_id,newComment.comment_text,1]);
    return addedComment;
};
```
### Description:
When called, this function adds the inputted comment as a new row in the database table.
### Parameters: 
_newComment_ - An object, with key-values: 
+ _user_id_: The ID corresponding to the user making the comment.
+ _comment_text_: The text content of the submitted comment.
+ _page_id_: The ID corresponding to the page the comment was submitted from.
### Returns:
The comment that was added, as an object, with the same key-values, plus the key _comment_id_, which is a primary key & identity, that the newly created comment was assigned.

<br>

## Deleting a comment:
```js
export async function deleteComment(commentId){
    let deleteCommentSQL = `DELETE FROM comments WHERE comments_id = $1 RETURNING *;`;
    let deletedComment = await query (deleteCommentSQL, [commentId]);
    return deletedComment;
}
```
### Description:
When called, this function deletes the selected comment from the database table.
### Parameters: 
_comment_id_ - The unique id corresponding to the comment to be deleted.
